# Operation

Note: The Power switch is recessed into the front of the Expansion Interface to prevent accidental loss of power. Activate the switch with the eraser-end of a pencil or small tool of similar size.

Apply power to the Expansion Interface. Notice that when power is off, the end surface of the switch is white and when power is on, it changes to orange.
