# The NEW <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> <span data-keyref="peripheral_name" />

A vital part of <span data-keyref="company_name" />'s modular design, this single interface enables you to upgrade your system as your needs increase. It contains sockets for additional 16K or 32K RAM and a disk controller for up to for mini-disks. Software-selectable dual cassettes can be used. It attaches to (and continues) the <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> bus, and features a Centronics parallel port, real time clock, and a card slot for an RS-232C interface--or whatever! Usually requires Level-II BASIC.
