# Three Typical E-X-P-A-N-D-E-D <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> Systems

## 4K "EDUCATOR" System 
The "EDUCATOR" System includes our screen printer for a "hard copy" computing system useful in keeping track of household records and point-of-sale receipts. In addition, the "EDUCATOR" is ideally suited for computer-assisted instruction programs. 

INCLUDES: 
- <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> with 4K RAM, Level-I BASIC (26-1001) 
- 12" Video Display (26-1201) 
- RealisticÂ® CTR-41 Cassette Recorder (14-841) 
- <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> Screen Printer (26-1151) 
- <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> "PROFESSIONAL" SYSTEM

## 16K "PROFESSIONAL" System
"PROFESSIONAL" System offers 16K RAM, mini-disk system, and a screen printer for applications in science and engineering, clinical laboratories, statistical analysis, and software development. A major plus of this 
is its potential to eliminate expensive "on-line" costs. 

INCLUDES: 
- <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> with 16K RAM, Level-II BASIC (26-1006) 
- 12" Video Display (26-1201) 
- CT-41 Recorder (14-841) 
- <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> Screen Printer (26-1151) 
- <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> <span data-keyref="peripheral_name" /> (26-1140) 
- <span data-keyref="computer_model" /> Mini-Disk System (26-1160)
