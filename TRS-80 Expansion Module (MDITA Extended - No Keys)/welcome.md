# Welcome to the World of Personal Computing

We've been living in the Computer Age for more than twenty years. But most people still think of computers as million dollar electronic monsters.

You've seen the made-for-the-movies computer. Rows of flashing lights, whirring sounds, bespectacled men in white lab coats seated at mysterious control panels. Feed some punched cards, paper tapes, tax returns and financial statements in one end...and out pop more punched cards, more paper tapes, bills and credit statements.

This "Please don't fold, spindle or mutilate" reputation of the computer is about to be demolished (finally!) by the remarkable advances in miniaturization which gave us the pocket calculator and digital watch. The **microcomputer** has arrived, and computers are going to become as common as telephones and television sets. 

Think of the impact on the way we conduct business, educate students and keep track of our personal finances! Now the power of the computer to the appliance repair shop, the accountant, the neighborhood classroom, the corner grocer, even the individual. 

The microcomputer is ushering in a fantastic new phase of the Computer Age. *Welcome to the World of Personal Computing!*
