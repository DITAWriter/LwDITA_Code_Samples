# Operation

<div data-class="note"><p>The Power switch is recessed into the front of the Expansion Interface to prevent accidental loss of power. Activate the switch with the eraser-end of a pencil or small tool of similar size.</p></div>

Apply power to the Expansion Interface. Notice that when power is off, the end surface of the switch is white and when power is on, it changes to orange.
