        <p>Possibly, you will not need all of the expansion modules that are available but, we have
            supplied you with Hoods for cable connectors for a complete expansion system. Use the Hoods
            as illustrated to prevent accidental mismatch between the edge connectors on the PCB and
            the cable connectors.</p>
        <p>In the event that you lose a Door or Hood and want to replace it, we have given you a Parts
            List. You may refer to the Parts List and exploded diagrams to determine its Part Number.
            You can order replacement parts through your local <ph keyref="company_name"/> store.</p>
        <p>You must have a LEVEL II BASIC <ph keyref="computer_model"/> Microcomputer to utilize the
            <ph keyref="computer_model"/>
            <ph keyref="peripheral_name"/>, the Line Printer and the Mini-Disk modules. If you have a
            LEVEL I BASIC machine, it must be modified to accept LEVEL II programs. The Screen Printer
            is the only expansion module that may be connected directly to the <ph
                keyref="computer_model"/> Microcomputer and that will operate with LEVEL I machines.</p>
        <p>We are continually improving and updating our <ph keyref="computer_model"/> Microcomputer
            System. You will be kept informed through our Newsletters (you are on the mailing list),
            addenda and revisions to the Manual.</p>
        <p>For the complete Electrical Connections Block Diagram, see the concluding figure below
            describing the maximum possible set of peripheral devices that can be connected via the
            expansion interface.</p>
