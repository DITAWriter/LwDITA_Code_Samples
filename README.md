# LwDITA_Code_Samples
A set of code samples designed to demonstrate what is possible for each of the "flavors" of Lightweight DITA. All examples are based on  sections of various TRS-80 manuals from the late-1970s/early-1980s that have either lapsed or have been donated into the Public Domain. Includes sample marketing material, computer hardware content, software samples, legal frontmatter and glossary.

These files represent one interpretation as to how Lightweight DITA markup ought to be done, based on information available in the current version of the [Lightweight DITA Committee Note](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/59950/LwDITA-v1.0-cn01.pdf), and the sample files that come with it.  

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (MDITA Core)
This set of files were created using MDITA Core markup. 

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (MDITA Expanded - No Keys) 
These files were created using MDITA Expanded markup, which includes YAML headers and a mixed HDITA markup for things like the definition lists that appear in the glossary. 

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (MDITA Expanded - With Keys) 
This set of sample files are the same as the previous example, but with the addition of keyrefs. The values are set in the "map" file (index.md) and are expressed in the individual MDITA topics.

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (HDITA) [TBD]
These files are functionally the same as the "MDITA Expanded version" with keys, but use HDITA markup.

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (XDITA) [TBD]
These files are functionally the same as the "MDITA Expanded version" and the "HDITA version", but use XDITA markup. These files should be directly usable in any DITA 1.3 compliant setup.

## TRS-80 Expansion Module ("Full" DITA 1.3) [TBD]
This version of the files is done using "full" DITA 1.3, so the topics are typed, and follow DITA writing best practices.
