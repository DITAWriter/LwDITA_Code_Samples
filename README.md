# LwDITA_Code_Samples
A set of code samples designed to demonstrate what is possible for each of the "flavors" of Lightweight DITA. All examples are based on various TRS-80 manuals which are out of copyright. Includes sample marketing material, computer hardware content, software samples, legal matter and glossary.

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (MDITA Core)
This set of files were created using MDITA Core markup. 

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (MDITA Expanded) [TBD]
These files were created using MDITA Expanded markup, which includes YAML headers and a mixed HDITA markup for things like the definition lists that appear in the glossary. 

## TRS-80 Expansion Module (MDITA Expanded - with Keyrefs) [TBD]
This set of sample files are the same as the previous example, but with the addition of keyrefs. The values are set in the "map" file (index.md) and are expressed in the individual MDITA topics.
