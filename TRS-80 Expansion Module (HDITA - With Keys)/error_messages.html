    <h1>Error Messages</h1>
    <p>There are three kinds of error messages you might get while using your computer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Boot errors, such as BOOT ERROR DC. See the Boot Errors Table for more information.</li>
      <li>Operating system errors, such as ERROR 24 or FILE NOT FOUND. To get a brief description of
        a numbered error, type <span>ERROR</span> followed by the error number displayed. For
        example, type:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>ERROR 31 (ENTER)</span></p>
    <p>and your screen shows:</p>
    <p><span>PROGRAM NOT FOUND</span></p>
    <p>For more information see the System Errors Table.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Application program errors: see your application program manual.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When an error message is displayed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try the operation several times.</li>
      <li>Look up boot errors and operating system errors in the following tables and take the
        recommended actions. See your application program manual for explanations of application
        program errors.</li>
      <li>Try using other diskettes.</li>
      <li>Reset the computer and try the operation again.</li>
      <li>Check all the power connections.</li>
      <li>Check all interconnections.</li>
      <li>Remove all diskettes from drives, turn off the computer, wait 15 seconds, and turn it on
        again.</li>
      <li>If you tried all these remedies and continue to get an error message, contact a <span
          data-keyref="company_name"></span> Service Center.</li>
    </ul>
    <div data-class="note">If more than one thing is wrong, the computer might wait until you
      correct the first error before displaying the second error message.</div>
