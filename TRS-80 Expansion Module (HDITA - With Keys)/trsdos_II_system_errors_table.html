    <p>These codes are also returned to machine code routines that call a SVC (System Service Call)
      of TRSDOS-II. Register A usually has a return code after any function call. The Z flag is set
      when no error occurs. Exceptions are certain computational routines, which use Registers A and
      F to pass back data and status information.</p>
