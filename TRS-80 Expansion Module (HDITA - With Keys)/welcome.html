        <h1>Welcome to the World of Personal Computing</h1>
        <p>We've been living in the Computer Age for more than twenty years. But most people still
            think of computers as million dollar electronic monsters.</p>
        <p>You've seen the made-for-the-movies computer. Rows of flashing lights, whirring sounds,
            bespectacled men in white lab coats seated at mysterious control panels. Feed some
            punched cards, paper tapes, tax returns and financial statements in one endâ€¦and out pop
            more punched cards, more paper tapes, bills and credit statements.</p>
        <p>This "Please don't fold, spindle or mutilate" reputation of the computer is about to be
            demolished (finally!) by the remarkable advances in miniaturization which gave us the
            pocket calculator and digital watch. The <strong>microcomputer</strong> has arrived, and
            computers are going to become as common as telephones and television sets.</p>
        <p>Think of the impact on the way we conduct business, educate students and keep track of
            our personal finances! Now the power of the computer to the appliance repair shop, the
            accountant, the neighborhood classroom, the corner grocer, even the individual.</p>
        <p>The microcomputer is ushering in a fantastic new phase of the Computer Age. <em>Welcome
                to the World of Personal Computing!</em></p>
