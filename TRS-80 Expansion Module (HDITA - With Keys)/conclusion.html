        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Possibly, you will not need all of the expansion modules that are available but, we have
            supplied you with Hoods for cable connectors for a complete expansion system. Use the
            Hoods as illustrated to prevent accidental mismatch between the edge connectors on the
            PCB and the cable connectors.</p>
        <p>In the event that you lose a Door or Hood and want to replace it, we have given you a
            Parts List. You may refer to the Parts List and exploded diagrams to determine its Part
            Number. You can order replacement parts through your local <span
                data-keyref="company_name"></span> store.</p>
        <p>You must have a LEVEL II BASIC <span data-keyref="computer_model"></span> Microcomputer
            to utilize the <span data-keyref="computer_model"></span>
            <span data-keyref="peripheral_name"></span>, the Line Printer and the Mini-Disk modules.
            If you have a LEVEL I BASIC machine, it must be modified to accept LEVEL II programs.
            The Screen Printer is the only expansion module that may be connected directly to the
                <span data-keyref="computer_model"></span> Microcomputer and that will operate with
            LEVEL I machines.</p>
        <p>We are continually improving and updating our <span data-keyref="computer_model"></span>
            Microcomputer System. You will be kept informed through our Newsletters (you are on the
            mailing list), addenda and revisions to the Manual.</p>
        <p>For the complete Electrical Connections Block Diagram, see the concluding figure below
            describing the maximum possible set of peripheral devices that can be connected via the
            expansion interface.</p>
