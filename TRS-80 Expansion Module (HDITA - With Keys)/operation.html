        <div data-class="note">The Power switch is recessed into the front of the <span
                    data-keyref="peripheral_name"></span> to prevent accidental loss of power.
                Activate the switch with the eraser-end of a pencil or small tool of similar
                size.</div>
        <p>Apply power to the <span data-keyref="peripheral_name"></span>. Notice that when power is
            off, the end surface of the switch is white and when power is on, it changes to
            orange.</p>
